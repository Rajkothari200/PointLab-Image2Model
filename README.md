# PointLab-Image2Model
PointLab – Image2Model is a research-driven engineering project that transforms 2D photographs into accurate, metric 3D point clouds and mesh reconstructions. By integrating classical image preprocessing with advanced Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) algorithms through COLMAP, PointLab provides high-fidelity model generation directly from standard camera imagery.  Our mission is to streamline the 3D reconstruction workflow for research, education, and industrial applications — making the process transparent, explainable, and reproducible. From preprocessing (contrast enhancement, denoising, sharpening, segmentation) to dense fusion, every step in PointLab is modular, parameter-controlled, and optimized for precision and performance.
